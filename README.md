Here are some coding projects I work on.
Right now I only have one public one. Old Prodigy.

# Old Prodigy

This is some pretty simple modding of older versions of Prodigy, to get them to work right now, in the present day!
If you want a little dose of nostalgia from older Prodigy versions, no matter what the purpose - 
seeing the older battle systems, the older quests, or anything of the sort - 
then you know where you are, and you know what to do!

There are a lot of versions to choose from based on your preferences, covering YEARS worth of updates from Prodigy's team!

I am still actively working on bettering it, so if you have any problems with bugs, glitches, etc. Just make an issue
and I'll try to address it as soon as I can!

## How to play

Playing this couldn't be more simple. First thing you have to do is open the site, which is automatically updated from this
repository!

To do so, you just click this link: https://daboss7173.github.io/oldprodigy/select

Once you're there, you can select a version to play. There are LOTS of versions to choose from, so try not to be overwhelmed
by the number of choices, and there are still more versions and updates to come!

Once you've selected a version, it'll take you to the login screen where you have 3 options. To create a new wizard, to start in offline mode,
or to load a previous save.

If you want to start a quick game and not configure how your character appears, you should choose offline mode.

If you want to start a new game and configure your character however you want, you should choose to create a new character.

If you want to load a character that you've already saved, you click load character and select your save file.

To save your character, you can just go into the settings menu, go under 'network' and click the button called "save character". It'll automatically download
to your computer, For this I recommend manually choosing a folder to save it in so you can organize it as you need. If there is no network tab in the version
you're playing in, click the 'other' tab instead.

## Modpacks

This repository features dynamic modpacks, you will be able to toggle mods as you see fit, and be able to combine multiple mods together for dynamic modpacks.

Currently, these are the versions that support modpacks:
 - 1-30-0
 - 1-50-0

## Version choice breakdown!

Okay, maybe the versions are a bit overwhelming. Let's break it down a bit!

- 1.11.0 | The oldest version that can run essentially flawlessly.

  Now don't get me wrong, this isn't the oldest version of Prodigy ever, but it's pretty old! Lots of old elements around that aren't seen in newer versions.
  This was the last archived version to include some classic GUI elements.

- 1.16.5 | The oldest version with all of the legacy quests, and the element selection.

  This is a version that I recommend in particular, it's kind of like 1.11.0 - but it's generally a lot more stable. In fact this version
  is one of the most stable Prodigy versions on this site!

- 1.17.0 | The oldest version with tiled maps!

  This version was the first to introduce a new tutorial, more in-depth than 1.16.5 and before, which would end up being used all the way up to 1.30.0!
  Not only did this version have that, but it also introduced the precursor to the modern firefly forest (before they updated the tileset and updated Flora's sprite)

- 1.18.2 | All Hallow's Eve!

  This version is really neat because it has the first Pumpkinfest! This means Halloween decorations are all around the map, and there's a Pumpkinfest shop, with all-kinds
  of exclusive, creepy items and gear you can buy with your gold! Other than that it's pretty much just like 1.17.0.

- 1.24.0 | A whole lot of stuff added in!

  This version introduced the new Shiverchill Mountains quests, a new tile-based Lamplight town, as well as a LOT of new menu designs added in.
  Pretty safe to say a LOT happened between 1.18.2 and this version.

- 1.30.0 | Just as many radical changes!

  This version had the updated Skywatch, the updated Bonfire Spire, AND an updated map screen! This version also introduced achievements and all kinds of
  other, more subtle changes. This version is another one that I really recommend trying out, another definitive update.

- 1.37.0 | New Lamplight Town and tutorial!

  This version had a brand-new tutorial, which is the base for the MODERN DAY Prodigy tutorial, even though it's been changed in multiple ways, the resemblance is
  uncanny! This also brought in the modern-style Lamplight Town, now some things are arranged differently, but it's still essentially the same. This version
  also has Winterfest, which is pretty cool if you're interested in that.

- 1.39.0 | Crazy battle update!?

  This version introduced a refresh on the battle system, with a new health meter not using hearts, but a health bar! It also shows how much damage is dealt in
  each attack, and introduces critical hits. This also has leveling up mid-battle and some new animations to accompany this! This version also has the Firefly Forest
  reskin, which looks really cool!

- 1.46.2 | Potions and Epic Attacks!?
  This version added not only Potions, but was also the first to have Epic Attacks! The tutorial route was also re-worked a bit. Rather than going through the heart of
  Lamplight town, this version just passes through the shop district, and is overall a less drawn-out tutorial.

- 1.50.0 | Sound Effects Galore!

  This version has added plenty of stuff! New sound effects for the Epic Attacks, as well as a new spell cast sound effect, and spell hit sound effect. There is also a
  sound effect for when you level up, and a new sound effect for critical hits. The Shiverchill Mountain textures also got updated in this version. The Twilight Wheel even
  got added in this version!

- 1.51.0 | NEW AVATAR!?

  This update has always been a bit controversial... The avatar was completely reworked in this version, and instead of using sprite sheets, it used atlases. This means
  that the animations could be a LOT smoother than before! However, it just plain didn't have the same amount of detail that the previous avatar had.
  The loading system also got a bit of internal reworking in this update, meaning that some icons would have some loading issues, which is the main reason I
  recommend 1.50.0 over this update.

- 1.60.0 | ARGH! OUR SHIP IS SINKING MATEYS! WE'RE GONNA WRECK!

  Ahem - anyway, this update was one of the first with the Starlight Festival! This update also introduced the new in-game chat, although it's not a big deal anyway since
  this is in offline mode... Ooh! Also, this brought in Shipwreck Shore, replacing Barnacle Cove! This also has Pippet Battles! Also, the Skywatch textures were also
  redone in this version.

- 1.70.0 | Huh I can dab now? Cool

  This update added in some quest progress popups for when you enter the following areas: Firefly Forest, Shiverchill Mountain, Skywatch, Bonfire Spire, and Shipwreck
  Shore. Also the Dark Tower got completely redesigned with a tileset model. The Bonfire Spire textures were redone in this version as well.
  Oh and aside from all that stuff, you can dab now. There's also Winterfest, and 4 new epics are added in now. Pretty nifty.

- 1.80.0 | A battle overhaul!?

  Wow, that was quick- YOU HAVE SEEN NOTHING YET SONNY BOY! Huh. Ok - Anyway, the battle got changed a bit so that instead of having up to 4 pets, you only have up to 2.
  HOWEVER They are all on screen at the same time and the battle background uses tilesets now.

- 1.90.0 | Bunnies Vs. Foxes!

  The leaderboards got overhauled a bit and overall look way brighter than before. Also, the Dyno Dig Oasis quests are phased out now, Professor Scoog is now a shopkeeper.
  This version also includes some general stability improvements, and the first Springfest in Prodigy was also here. Also a lot of new music was added in!

- 2.6.0 | Another battle overhaul!

  The battle system has been revised once again! This time the entire battle GUI was overhauled, and all of the old spells got phased out in favor of newer, more smoothly animated spells. Not only that, but the health/balancing systems have been re-worked so that players, especially higher leveled players have a TON of health. This also marks a point where a lot of fonts start to get replaced by vector fonts.

- 2.20.0 | Getting some gale force winds here guys

  This update has the academy! You'll be able to go into the archives, meet Gale, and do all sorts of stuff there. There are also a lot of GUI changes here. The character
  name now uses a vector font now. The settings menu also got a glow-up!

- 2.30.0 | Brrr! It's getting cold again!
  This update changed the logo to a more simplified version! Also, Winterfest is back and Howard Cornelius's sprite was switched up! Also, they added the nicknamers back
  in Shiverchill Mountains, Firefly Forest, Skywatch, and Bonfire Spire! They also updated the sprite for the Nicknamer, as well as the menu!

Well- okay, maybe it's still a bit overwhelming. At least you know what you're getting in each version though!

## The other version

There's one version I haven't mentioned yet, it is the least buggy out of all of these versions.

- The current version | The most functional build!

  Huh? The current version? This isn't Old Prodigy! Well - maybe not, but it is THE Prodigy, it is more Prodigy than any of these versions. The full-game experience is
  to be experienced there. There is no other version of Prodigy with fully-fledged multiplayer. There is no other version with fully functional leaderboards. There is no other
  version with the intricately designed education system, and there is no other version that consistently gets updated by a dedicated team of truly wonderful people. For that,
  you need to play Prodigy, as it is now.
